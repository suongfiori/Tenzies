### Topics covered

- [x] Use of React hooks such as **`useState`** and **`useEffect`** to handle state and side effects respectively
- [x] **`useEffect`** hook is used to handle the side effects such as checking if the game is won or not by checking the value of the dice and also **starting** and **stopping** the timer
- [x] Conditional rendering is used to render different elements in JSX depending on the **state** of the game, whether it is **won** or **not**
- [x] **`map()`** method is used to iterate over the dice array and create JSX elements for each die
- [x] **`setInterval()`** and **`clearInterval()`** are used to **create** and **stop** the timer respectively
- [x] Use of **`nanoid`** library to generate unique ids for each die.

### Possible ideas for project enhancing

- [ ] Improving *User Interface*: adding animations, sound effects, more visually appealing (reall dots on the dice).
- [ ] Adding *instructions*: more detailed instructions on how to play.
- [ ] Adding more *game modes*: time-based challenges / points-based challenges.
- [ ] Adding a *leaderboard*: track the high scores of players and make the game more competitive.
- [ ] Adding a *multiplayer mode*: players can compete against each other online.
- [ ] Improving *mobile compatibility*.
- [ ] Adding *save and resume feature*: allow players to save their progress and resume later on.
